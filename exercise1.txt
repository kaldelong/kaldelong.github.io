Bio: I’m a Seattle-born designer currently pursuing a BFA at Western Washington University. My passions lie in experimental typography, editorial layout, and motion graphics. I hope to bridge these interests by pursuing a career in branding.

I’m a community-minded individual who loves to give and receive critique. I find I’ve grown the most while working collaboratively and I believe that there’s something to learn from everyone.

When I’m not designing, you might find me wandering the aisles of an antique store, snapping photos, or catching up on my current favorite reality tv show!
